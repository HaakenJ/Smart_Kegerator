# Primary Materials List

### Touchscreen

    - Size:
        - 7" or bigger?
    - Type:
        - Capacitive:
	    - More accurate, thinner
	    - More expensive, can only use fingers (capacitive devices)
	- Resistive:
	    - Cheaper, can use any device to touch

### Raspberry Pi
    
    - Model:
	- At least Pi 2 B
	    - Research benefits of higher model
		- More inputs, price, necessary computing power, wifi etc.
    - Required accessories:
	- Power supply
	- Case (maybe)
	- cables
	- SD card

### Flow sensors

    - Will need two, can't test these until kegerator is set up.

### Temp sensors
  
    - Can use the DHT11 sensors for frige temp.

### User Interface

    - Clearly not a physical material but will need to be developed.

    - Can use React or React Native

    - Users Add/Remove
	- Track user's consumption
	- Easily reset user's consumption
	    - Can have a new keg button that resets everything.
	    - Have admin password to change values
        - When a new keg is addded automatically invoice users for their usage

    - Keg setup screen
	- Cost of keg and size (will be used to determine price per oz)
	- Type of beer
	    - Add API to find data about this beer and let the user confirm
	    then auto-populate the beer data.

    - Track temperature and usage over time with graphs



# Possible materials

### Camera module for facial recognition

    - Automatically determine which user is pouring beer
    - Take pictures and post to twitter
    - NOIR camera with IR lighting for dark photos
    - Will need a decent looking case

### Weight Sensors

    - May be a better way to keep track of how much beer is left

### LED's

    - Can always integrate these somehow
